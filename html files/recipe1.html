            <h2>12 of the Most Laborious Dishes You’ll Ever (Try to) Make</h2>
            <p>
In an episode of her iconic television cooking show, “The French Chef,” Julia Child refers to a soufflé as “only a thick, white sauce with a flavoring in it, like cheese or mushrooms,” adding, “and into this you fold stiffly beaten egg whites.” It’s simple, she seems to imply; just mix a few ingredients, pour them into a pan and, poof! Like magic, it will puff up in the oven like an omelette on steroids into a beautiful, towering masterpiece that will make your guests ooo and aah. But, oh, so many things can go wrong. You might burn the roux, a mixture of butter and flour that serves as the base to any French white sauce, or fail to beat the egg whites to enough of a stiff peak. You may even fail to secure the collar, built out of wax paper or aluminum foil and taped or pinned to side of the pan, well enough to support the whole shebang as it inflates dramatically up above the edge. Worst of all, you may cook it the wrong amount of time: too little, and the middle of your soufflé will be a runny mess; too much, and it will be dry and flavorless. If you wait too long to serve it after taking it out of the oven, your gorgeous creation may also begin to deflate. Such a temperamental dish! Ready to take it on? Get our Soufflé recipes.
Emulsification is the key to this classic French condiment, which is a close relative to hollandaise. It’s not the what, but the how in terms of combining your ingredients (salt, pepper, egg yolks, butter, shallots, tarragon, and white wine vinegar) for a successful béarnaise. This involves simmering everything but the egg yolks and butter together so the flavors meld, letting the mixture cool long enough not to cook the egg yolks once you add them, and then, over a double boiler, whisking the whole thing over low heat until it thickens and doubles in volume. Now, here comes the hard part: whisking the butter in quickly, a bit at a time, so that the sauce emulsifies into a delightfully creamy consistency. If you don’t, the sauce will separate and become pretty much useless, which is how you’ll feel by this point if this happens to you. Feeling plucky? Get our Béarnaise recipe.
Like any other flaky French pastry, croissants are made with laminated dough. But unlike other buttery baked goods, such as biscuits, laminated pastries are made by creating a yeasted dough, kneading it, letting it rise at least an hour (or even overnight), rolling it out, folding it over butter that has been beaten and chilled, rolling it out again, chilling it, and repeating those last three steps—fold, roll, chill—over and over again until the dough is ready to be cut and shaped into that familiar crescent shape. It takes a lot of time and patience to get this technique down, and if you’re short on either, then save yourself the hassle and order your croissants from your local bakery so you can focus on enjoying them. But if you want to make like you’re on “The Great British Baking Show,” get King Arthur Flour’s Croissant recipe.
When it comes to soups like pho or ramen, the secret to greatness is in the broth (same goes for bun bo hue). Andrea Nguyen, who won a James Beard award for “The Pho Cookbook” in 2018, provides clear instructions for making the best beef pho possible: Start with good beef bones, parboil and rinse them to prevent creating an oily residue in the broth, then gently simmer the bones in water for at least three hours. Once it’s cooked, the broth must then be strained, the fat must be skimmed off, and it should be flavored with salt, sugar, and fish sauce. In the meantime, all the fixings—thinly sliced and chilled beef, blanched noodles, onion and ginger that has been charred, skinned and chopped to create a deeper flavor—should be assembled and ready to be placed in soup bowls before ladling that gorgeous broth over it all and garnishing it with any combination of cilantro, Thai basil, bean sprouts, and lime wedges. Or, you could just opt to make our Easy Chicken Pho recipe instead.
Does the idea of getting splattered with hot melted duck fat and creating a greasy mess in your oven sound appealing? Then yes, making a whole roasted duck at home is the right decision for you! Over several hours of cooking, you will need to continuously check on your bird to remove excess fat from the bottom of the pan and carefully turn it over to ensure it cooks evenly until, finally, it’s done. Then, if you still have the strength, you’ll be ready to carve it, serve it and pray it didn’t turn into a tough, stringy mess from overcooking it. Get our Marmalade Roasted Duck recipe if you’re up for it. Or, for an equally rewarding experience with a lot less risk, try making just the Duck Breast—or our 
Baked Alaska done right is as magical as pulling a rabbit out of a hat. First, make a cake. After it’s cooled, put it into the refrigerator to chill (preferably overnight). Then, top it with ice cream, stick the whole thing in the freezer to make sure it doesn’t melt, take it out, encase it in a thick layer of whipped meringue, return it to the freezer to make sure it doesn’t melt, and then bake it in the oven. Frozen ice cream baked in an oven…what could go wrong?! Well, if you fail to seal the edges of the meringue, which acts as insulation for the ice cream, to the baking sheet the whole thing is resting on, you’ll have a soggy mess in addition to disappointed guests. But fear not! Our Easy Baked Alaska recipe suggests using a blowtorch, instead of the oven, for perfect a dessert every time.
Much like laminated dough, making your own phyllo dough by hand is a royal PITA. Don’t believe me? Check out this video for proof. If, instead, you decide to purchase the dough ready-made for your homemade spanakopita (a.k.a. spinach pie), you’ll be glad you did. It will make this dish much easier to assemble, much like making lasagna with store-bought (rather than homemade) pasta. Otherwise, you’ll be rolling, stretching, folding, and chilling the phyllo dough for hours and hours. So get thee to the grocery store and then make our Spanakopita recipe.
While it may sound like a quaint way to preserve the fruits of your labor, making jam is a lengthy process (even though most recipes only require a few ingredients). The fruit must be washed and, depending on which kind you use, may also need to be hulled, cut, and/or crushed. Then, in addition to cooking the fruit down with sugar and pectin or lemon juice until it jells, you must also prepare the containers. The jars must be washed and sanitized, the lids must be heated, and, once filled with jam, the sealed jars must then be processed in a boiling water bath. The worst part is that in most cases, since fruit ripens in the heat of summer, it is best preserved then, too. And who wants to spend a hot summer day indoors working over steaming pots of water and simmering jam? The bright side: If you want to use it right away, you can skip the sterilizing—and you can check out our slow cooker jams and preserves too.
Most people only ever have the opportunity to try cassoulet at a restaurant, and with good reason. It’s one of the most notoriously difficult and time-consuming dishes to make. The beans must be soaked, drained, rinsed, and then cooked with a variety of vegetables and herbs. The duck legs must be cured, and then baked in their own fat and deboned to make confit. The pork must be cooked into a ragout. Then, all three, dishes in their own right, must be layered into a dutch oven, along with cooked sausages, and topped with homemade breadcrumbs before baking for hours, during which time the crust must be broken every half hour to ensure it soaks up enough liquid to create the right consistency. In other words, this dish takes days to make and, during that time, it will rule your life so completely that by the time it’s finally done and ready to eat, you’ll be bleary-eyed and wondering whether you made the cassoulet or it made you. Undaunted? Get the Cassoulet recipe.
Unless you live in a climate-controlled environment without a hint of humidity, don’t even think about making macarons at home; meringues and moist air just don’t mix well. Once you’ve passed this hurdle, it’s on to the next: creating a crisp, light cookie by one of two methods, either of which can easily go very wrong. The first involves beating sugar, almond meal, and egg whites together into the perfect airy consistency and racing to pipe it onto a baking sheet before it deflates. The second, known as Italian meringue, involves slowly and carefully beating a hot sugar syrup into egg whites that have been whipped into soft peaks. If the sugar syrup isn’t cooked to the right temperature, if the egg whites are too soft or too stiff, or if the combination of the two is overmixed, the meringue will not turn out correctly and your macarons will deflate, along with all of your most treasured hopes and dreams. If we haven’t scared you off, try our Chocolate Macarons recipe.
This classic dish involves creating and assembling several rather rich parts to make one over-the-top whole. Start by making a broth out of roasted beef bones, reducing it down by two-thirds and using it to make a Madeira sauce. Next, make puffed pastry, which is a laminated dough (see Croissants above for more information on how fun it is to make this on its own). Then make duxelles, which is a mixture of chopped mushrooms cooked with shallots, herbs, and lots of butter. If you’re still willing to go through with this whole thing, whip up a batch of crepes and set them aside for later use. Take your beef tenderloin, which has been refrigerated, patted dry, and seasoned, sear it on all sides in butter, and let it cool. Combine the duxelles with paté, slather the mixture onto the crepes, and then wrap the crepes completely around the beef tenderloin. Then, take your chilled puffed pastry, roll it out and wrap it around the crepe-wrapped tenderloin. Make sure the pastry is tightly sealed around the Wellington with no air pockets. Brush it with an egg wash, refrigerate it, let it sit until it gets to room temperature, brush it with an egg wash again, score the top with a knife, roast it in the oven and serve it, sliced, with the Madeira sauce. Try not to collapse into a limp heap on the floor before you bring it to the table. Willing to commit? Get our Beef Wellington recipe.
Beware any recipe that claims pâte à choux dough is easy to make. It’s not. Pâte à choux is used to create the pastry for eclairs, cream puffs and profiteroles, which are filled, respectively, with custard, pastry cream, and ice cream. Croquembouche is a classic french dessert constructed by piling cream puffs into a pyramid-like tower and drizzling it with caramel sauce that hardens into crunchy strands that look like a fluffy bird’s nest. Stirring the dough while it cooks and comes together into the right consistency takes more effort than you might imagine; in fact, I once got tennis elbow from doing it. To prevent injury, make the dough in small batches or, better yet, buy the pastry ready-made so you can get straight to fun stuff: stacking the cream puffs as high as you dare and covering your architectural masterpiece in hot caramel sauce. Feeling confident? Get the Croquembouche recipe.
I'm always up for a challenge when it comes to cooking a dish with many, many steps. But, sometimes my confidence gets the best of me and I end up miserably failing at cooking whatever it is I decided to make.

For years, I had my eye on this layered Bon Appetit magazine cover recipe, Devil's Food cake with a beautiful white fluffy peppermint frosting, silky dark chocolate ganache and smooth white chocolate cream. My mother collects magazines, so during Thanksgiving and Christmas I frequently read through them searching for the perfect recipe to make. A couple Christmases ago, I decided to try this one. As I attempted to assemble the dessert, everything went wrong. My ganache was too runny, the frosting was not thick enough and my cakes were too delicate; I ended up supporting the leaning tower of three cake layers with chopsticks, hoping and praying it would not collapse on my kitchen counter. I should have read the recipe more before I began making it because I was way in over my head.

Despite my failed efforts at making a cover-worthy recipe, I still don't back down from challenges, I just use better resources to figure out what I am doing. So, for all of you risk-takers and over-achievers, here are the ten most difficult recipes to make at home with some references to help you not only finish the dish, but make it a tasty one, too.

10. Salt-Crusted Fish

Having a chef make salt-crusted fish for you at a restaurant is a splendid treat. Despite an entire fish being covered in salt like someone being buried in sand at the beach, the plated result is not overly salted. But, if you don't pack the salt and egg white mixture tight enough, you risk salt crystals leaking into the fish as it cooks and when you break into the shell, creating an almost unbearable flavor. Ease your stress by having your butcher clean and gut your fish, then check out this video from Fine Cooking for a demonstration on preparing the salt dome and properly covering the entire fish.

9. Baked Alaska

If you thought making an ice cream cake was hard, try making Baked Alaska. This dessert not only requires you to form a mold of ice cream around a cake, but you must also cover it with a meringue, then bake it in the oven. After several hours of assembling and freezing, you pour a liquor over the baked meringue and ignite with a flame. Cold desserts on fire are pretty sweet.

8. Macarons

Not only are macarons challenging to perfectly execute, but if you make them in a city with so much humidity, like Houston, you're going to have a much more difficult time. Even if the weather is perfect, things can easily go awry. Every step is crucial -- from combining the egg whites with the sugar and almond flour and piping the mixture onto a cookie sheet to baking and cooling the pastries for the appropriate time. Bakers strive to create the perfect macaron and some have yet to accomplish that feat. Watch this video from Fine Cooking which demonstrates how to make the classic French dessert.

7. Breakfast

I don't know about you, but making breakfast for a family of four, or more, is a daunting task -- my mom and I always had a difficult time even working as a team. Props to every short order cook because I can never seem to find a way to put breakfast on the table at the same time or at the same temperature for each person. Pancakes never come out perfectly and they require constant tending; French toast makes a mess and you have to be careful not to cover your counter in eggs; you always burn some toast (even though it's the easiest task); and don't even try to make eggs for everyone, unless they all agree on scrambled. You're using practically every appliance in your kitchen at the same time. Just talking about it stresses me out.

6. Lemon Meringue Pie

Anything with a meringue is difficult to make, but add a lemon curd and pie crust to the mix and you're in for a strenuous and tedious task. But, luckily, you can make things much easier by purchasing prepackaged dough so all you're left with is the filling and the meringue. Try this recipe from Gourmet; the instructions and comments from those who made it are quite helpful - add more lemon juice and less water if you want the lemon curd to be more tart.

5. Anything Flambéed

Flambéing is awesome in restaurants when a professional chef lights a liqueur on fire, especially when it is table-side. But flambéing at home is not only difficult, but also quite dangerous. I flambéed a dish once. It was the most terrifying experience of my life. Sure it's easy to light a match on fire, but when that fear rattles through your body as you inch the flame closer to the pan, you're most likely not going to follow through with the flambé. Or maybe that's just me.

4. Paella

You've probably eaten a paella of some kind in many Houston restaurants, or you might have been lucky enough to enjoy authentic paella in Spain. But, nailing the crispy, caramelized crust on the bottom and cooking the rice so it has that excellent bite (al dente) takes some practice. Making paella is all about the technique and the tools -- you need a large round pan (a paella pan) to create that crunchy bottom rice layer and as noted in a Fine Cooking article, you must create a sofrito by sautéing a combination of ingredients, such as tomatoes, onions and garlic with spices and herbs, such as paprika and parsley. Aside from mastering the sofrito and cooking the rice perfectly, you must add in a variety of crustaceans and meat, like clams, shrimp, lobster, chorizo and chicken. It's a lot of ingredients and requires an artful technique.

3. Molten Lava Cakes

Move aside soufflés, molten lava cakes take things to a whole new level. There's a reason this dish was a pressure test challenge on MasterChef; it's one of the most difficult desserts to perfect. You won't know if you accomplish cooking the outside of the cake and maintaining the "lava" of chocolate on the inside until you take a bite. Undercook it and the entire cake falls apart; overcook it and you essentially made a cake -- whoop dee freaking doo. Practice makes perfect, but I don't recommend practicing for dinner guests. Here's an awesome Vimeo depicting each step in making this luscious dessert.
